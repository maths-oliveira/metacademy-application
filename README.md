## Demo

Metacademy is live at http://www.metacademy.org.


## Installation

### Windows
For Windows installation/requirements, please see the README located in [/windows](/windows). These instructions here presume a *nix or OS X OS.


### Preliminary requirements
* `Python 2.7.X` *Note*: install `python-devel`/`python-dev` if you're using a package manager such as `yum` or `apt-get`. The following command should then print a path. If this command raises an exception, make sure that you have `python-devel`/`-dev` for your installed version of python installed:

        python -c 'from distutils.sysconfig import get_makefile_filename as m; print m()'

* `gcc` Install [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org) For OS X users, installing the [OS X developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/) is probably the easiest way to do this. The following command should not throw an error:

        gcc -v

* `pip` Install [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/); here are [pip's installation instructions](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html). The following command should not throw an error:

        pip -V

* `node.js` (needed to run tests): Install [node](http://nodejs.org/), preferably via [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) The following command should not throw an error:

        node -v


### Mac OS X and *nix

1. Create an empty top-level Metacademy directory in a desired location, e.g. `mkdir -p ~/MyProjects/metacademy`.

> It will be used for (1) the actual application, (2) storing the database and (3) the respective virtual Python environment.

2. Go to the top-level Metacademy directory `cd ~/MyProjects/metacademy`
3. From your top-level Metacademy directory, clone the application repo:

        git clone https://github.com/metacademy/metacademy-application.git

4. Go to the `metacademy-application` directory

        cd metacademy-application

5. Install the Metacademy application (Note: this project uses a [virtual environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) for development):

        make

    During the process confirm to load the initial dataset with `yes`.

    > Your Metacademy project directory now also contains the `local_dbs` and `meta_venv` directories.

6. Verify the installation

        make test

---

## Optional

The following tasks are not neccessarily needed to run Metacademy.

### Load `metacademy.org` data
Load the public data from metacademy.org

    python server/manage.py loaddata dev_utils/graph_data.json

### Create a Django superuser

A Django superuser will allow you to login at `/admin` to perform additional management tasks.

Given you are still in the `metacademy-application` directory, activate the virtual environment first.

    source ../meta_venv/bin/activate

Then create the Django superuser.

    python server/manage.py createsuperuser

You can leave the virtual environment again simply by invoking

    deactivate

## Very Optional

### Install `numpy` and `pandas` manually
They are needed for some legacy/aux function calls.

> **Note:** These dependencies should already be part of the *virtual environment* by running `make` above. Make sure to activate the virtual environment before continuing.

    pip install numpy

    pip install pandas

### Install `scipy` dependency

Some of Metacademy's ancillary functions currently depend on `scipy`. Scipy can be tricky to install, so we have made it an optional dependency. `pip install scipy` won't work unless you have all of the system-level dependencies.

Please refer to the [official Scipy installation instructions](http://www.scipy.org/install.html) to set it up for your Operating System / Linux Distribution.

Once you have `scipy` installed on your machine, link its `site-packages` folder to your virtual environment's `lib/python2.7/site-packages/` folder.

From within the `meta_venv` directory it could read

    ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/scipy lib/python2.7/site-packages/

or still from within the `metacademy-application` directory on a 64 bit RHEL-based system similiar to

    ln -s /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/scipy ../meta_venv/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/

---

## Execution

### Mac OS X and *nix

1. Start the virtual environment. You must do this for each new session.

        source ../meta_venv/bin/activate

2. Start the development server

        python server/manage.py runserver 8080

3. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a modern JavaScript-enabled browser

> Note: The initial search may take some time while the backend loads the graph into memory, but all subsequent pages should load much quicker.
